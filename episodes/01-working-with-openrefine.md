# Lesson

## Creating a Project


Start the program. (Double-click on the openrefine.exe. Java services will start on your machine, and OpenRefine will open in your browser).

Launch OpenRefine (see [Getting Started with OpenRefine](http://www.datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/00-getting-started/)).

OpenRefine can import a variety of file types, including tab separated (`tsv`), comma separated (`csv`), Excel (`xls`, `xlsx`), JSON, XML, RDF as XML, and Google Spreadsheets. See the [OpenRefine Create a Project by Importing Data page](https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/starting/#create-a-project-by-importing-data) for more information.

In this first step, we'll browse our computer to the sample data file for this lesson. In this case, we modified the `Portal_rodents` CSV file, adding several columns: `scientificName`, `locality`, `county`, `state`, `country` and generating several more columns in the lesson itself (`JSON`, `decimalLatitude`, `decimalLongitude`). Data in `locality`, `county`, `country`, `JSON`, `decimalLatitude` and `decimalLongitude` are contrived and are in no way related to the original dataset. 

If you haven't already, download the data from:  
[https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7823341](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7823341)

Once OpenRefine is launched in your browser, the left margin has options to `Create Project`, `Open Project`, or `Import Project`. Here we will create a new project:

1. Click `Create Project` and select `Get data from` `This Computer`.  
2. Click `Choose Files` and select the file `Portal_rodents_19772002_scinameUUIDs.csv`. Click `Open` or double-click on the filename.
3. Click `Next>>` under the browse button to upload the data into OpenRefine.  
4. OpenRefine gives you a preview - a chance to show you it understood the file. If, for example, your file was really tab-delimited, the preview might look strange, you would choose the correct separator in the box shown and click `Update Preview` (bottom right). If this is the wrong file, click `<<Start Over` (upper left).
5. If all looks well, click `Create Project>>` (upper right). 

Note that at step 1, you could upload data in a standard form from a web address by selecting `Get data from` `Web Addresses (URLs)`. However, this won't work for all URLs.

## Faceting

*Exploring data by applying multiple filters*

Facets are one of the most useful features of OpenRefine and can help get an overview of the data in a project as well as helping you bring more consistency to the data. OpenRefine supports faceted browsing as a mechanism for

* seeing the big picture of your data, and
* filtering down to just the subset of rows that you want to change in bulk.

A 'Facet' groups the values that appear in a column according to some criterion, and then allows you to filter the groups and edit values across many records at the same time.

One type of Facet is called a 'Text facet'. This groups all the identical text values in a column and lists each value with the number of records in which it appears. The facet information always appears in the left hand panel in the OpenRefine interface.

Here we will use faceting to look for potential errors in data entry in the `scientificName` column.

1. Scroll over to the `scientificName` column.
2. Click the down arrow and choose `Facet` > `Text facet`.
3. In the left panel, you'll now see a box containing every unique value in the `scientificName` column 
along with a number representing how many times that value occurs in the column.
4. Try sorting this facet by name and by count. Do you notice any problems with the data? What are they?
5. Hover the mouse over one of the names in the `Facet` list. You should see that you have an `edit` function available. 
6. You could use this to fix an error immediately, and OpenRefine will ask whether you want to make the same correction to every value it finds like that one. But OpenRefine offers even better ways to find and fix these errors, which we'll use instead. We'll learn about these when we talk about clustering.

> ## Solution
> 
> There will be several near-identical entries in `scientificName`. For example, there is one entry for `Ammospermophilis harrisi` and
> one entry for `Ammospermophilus harrisii`. These are both misspellings of `Ammospermophilus harrisi`. We will see how to correct these 
> misspelled and mistyped entries in a later exercise.

> [OpenRefine Manual: Facets](https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/facets)
> 
> As well as 'Text facets' OpenRefine also supports a range of other types of facet. These include:
> 
> * Numeric facets
> * Timeline facets (for dates)
> * Custom facets
> * Scatterplot facets
>
> **Numeric and Scatterplot facets** display graphs instead of lists of values. The numeric facet graph includes 'drag and drop' controls you can use to set a start and end range to filter the data displayed. These facets are explored further in [Examining Numbers in OpenRefine](http://www.datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/03-numbers/)
>
> **Custom facets** are a range of different types of facets. Some of the default custom facets are:
>
> * Word facet - this breaks down text into words and counts the number of records in which each word appears
> * Duplicates facet - this results in a binary facet of 'true' or 'false'. Rows appear in the 'true' facet if the value in the selected column is an exact match for a value in the same column in another row
> * Text length facet - creates a numeric facet based on the length (number of characters) of the text in each row for the selected column. This can be useful for spotting incorrect or unusual data in a field where specific lengths are expected (e.g. if the values are expected to be years, any row with a text length more than 4 for that column is likely to be incorrect)
> * Facet by blank - a binary facet of 'true' or 'false'. Rows appear in the 'true' facet if they have no data present in that column. This is useful when looking for rows missing key data.
{: .callout}

Facets are intended to group together common values and OpenRefine limits the number of values allowed in a single facet to ensure the software does not perform slowly or run out of memory. If you create a facet where there are many unique values (for example, a facet on a 'book title' column in a data set that has one row per book) the facet created will be very large and may either slow down the application, or OpenRefine will not create the facet.

> ## Exercise

> 1. Using faceting, find out how many years are represented in the census.

> 2. Is the column formatted as Number, Date, or Text? How does changing the format change the faceting display?

> > 3. After creating a facet, click `Sort by count` in the facet box. The year with the most observations is 1997. The least is 1977.

## Clustering

In OpenRefine, clustering means "finding groups of different values that might be alternative representations of the same thing". For example, the two strings `New York` and `new york` are very likely to refer to the same concept and just have capitalization differences. Likewise, `GÃ¶del` and `Godel` probably refer to the same person. Clustering is a very powerful tool for cleaning datasets which contain misspelled or mistyped entries. OpenRefine has several clustering algorithms built in. Experiment with them, and learn more about these algorithms and how they work. 

1. In the `scientificName` Text Facet we created in the step above, click the `Cluster` button.
2. In the resulting pop-up window, you can change the `Method` and the `Keying Function`. Try different combinations to 
 see what different mergers of values are suggested.
3. Select the `key collision` method and `metaphone3` keying function. It should identify three clusters. 
4. Click the `Merge?` box beside each, then click `Merge Selected and Recluster` to apply the corrections to the dataset.
4. Try selecting different `Methods` and `Keying Functions` again, to see what new merges are suggested. You may find there are 
 still improvements that can be made, but don't `Merge` again; just `Close` when you're done.  We'll now 
 see other operations that will help us detect and correct the remaining problems, and that have other, more general uses.

Important: If you `Merge` using a different method or keying function, or more times than described in the instructions above, 
your solutions for later exercises will not be the same as shown in those exercise solutions.

## Split


If data in a column needs to be split into multiple columns, and the parts are separated by a common separator (say a comma, or a space), you can use that separator to divide up the pieces into their own columns.


1. Let us suppose we want to split the `scientificName` column into separate columns for genus and for species. 
2. Click the down arrow at the top of the `scientificName` column. Choose `Edit Column` > `Split into several columns...`
3. In the pop-up, in the `Separator` box, replace the comma with a space. (use the spacebar to create a space, don't just delete the comma)
4. Uncheck the box that says `Remove this column`.
5. Click `OK`. You'll get some new columns called `scientificName 1`, `scientificName 2`, and so on.
6. Notice that in some cases `scientificName 1` and `scientificName 2` are empty. Why is this? What do you think we 
can do to fix this?
7. Note that the character on which the split is performed could be anything.  The default is a comma, and you changed 
that to a space in this case, but you could make it any letter or number or special character.  The only requirements
are that A) it appears in every row of the column, and B) it appears consistently in the place where you want the column
to be split.

> ## Solution
> 
> The entries that have data in `scientificName 3` and `scientificName 4` but not the first two `scientificName` columns 
> had an extra space at the beginning of the entry. Leading white spaces are very difficult to notice when cleaning data
> manually. This is another advantage of using OpenRefine to clean your data. We'll look at how to 
> fix leading and trailing white spaces in a later exercise.
{: .solution}

> ## Exercise
>
> Try to change the name of the second new column to "species". Are you able to do this?  Or do you encounter a problem?
> 
> > ## Solution
> > 
> > On the `scientificName 2` column, click the down arrow and then `Edit column` > `Rename this column`. Type "species" into 
> > the box that appears. A pop-up will appear that says `Another column already named species`. This is because there is another 
> > column where we've recorded the species abbreviation. If you capitalize the S, it will work.  Or you can choose another name  
> > like `speciesName` for this column or change the other `species` column name to `speciesAbbreviation`.
> {: .solution}

## Undo / Redo

It's common while exploring and cleaning a dataset to discover after you've made a change that you really should have done something else first. OpenRefine provides `Undo` and `Redo` operations to make this easy.


1. Click where it says `Undo / Redo` on the left side of the screen. All the changes you have made so far are listed here.
2. Click on the step that you want to go back to, in this case the previous step. The added columns will disappear.
3. Notice that you can still click on the last step and make the columns reappear, and toggle back and forth between these states.
4. Leave the dataset in the state in which the `scientificNames` were clustered, but not yet split.

Important: If you skip this step, your solutions for later exercises will not be the same as shown in those exercise solutions.


Important: `Undo` the splitting step before moving on to the next lesson. If you skip this step, your solutions 
for later exercises will not be the same as shown in those exercise solutions.
