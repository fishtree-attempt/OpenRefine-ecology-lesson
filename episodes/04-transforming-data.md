## Data clustering

Clustering allows you to find groups of entries that are not identical but are
sufficiently similar that they may be alternative representations of the same thing (term or data value).
For example, the two strings `New York` and `new york` are very likely to refer to the same concept and just have a
capitalization differences. Likewise, `BjÃ¶rk` and `Bjork` probably refer to the same person. These kinds of variations
occur a lot in scientific data. Clustering gives us a tool to resolve them.

OpenRefine provides different clustering algorithms. The best way to understand how they work is to experiment with them.

1. If you removed it, reinstate the `scientificName` text facet (you can also remove all the other facets to gain some space).
In the `scientificName` text facet box - click the `Cluster` button.
2. In the resulting pop-up window, you can change the `Method` and the `Keying Function`. Try different combinations to see what different mergers of values are suggested.
3. If you select the `key collision` method and the `metaphone3` keying function. It should identify three clusters.

4. Note that the `New Cell Value` column displays the new name that will replace the value in all the cells in the
group. You can change this if you wish to choose a different value than the suggested one.  Change the name selected for the cluster including `Ammospermophilus harrisii` to replace the name suggested with the correct one.
5. Tick the `Merge?` checkbox beside each group, then click `Merge Selected and Recluster` to apply the corrections to the dataset.
5. Try selecting different `Methods` and `Keying Functions` again, to see what new merges are suggested. You may find there are
   still improvements that can be made, but do not `Merge` again; just `Close` when you are done.  We will now see other operations that will help us detect and correct the remaining problems, and that have other, more general uses.

**Important:** If you `Merge` using a different method or keying function, or more times than described in the instructions above, your solutions for later exercises will not be the same as shown in those exercise solutions.

## Data splitting

It is easy to split data from one column into multiple columns if the parts are separated by a common separator (say a comma, or a space).

1. Let us suppose we want to split the `scientificName` column into separate columns, one for genus and one for species.
2. Click the down arrow next to the `scientificName` column. Choose `Edit Column` > `Split into several columns...`
3. In the pop-up, in the `Separator` box, replace the comma with a space (the box will look empty when you're done).
4. Important! Uncheck the box that says `Remove this column`.
5. Click `OK`. You should get some new columns called `scientificName 1`, `scientificName 2`, `scientificName 3`, and `scientificName 4`.
6. Notice that in some cases these newly created columns are empty (you can check by text faceting the column). Why? What do you think we can do to fix it?

The entries that have data in `scientificName 3` and `scientificName 4` but not the first two `scientificName` columns had an extra space at the beginning of the entry. Leading and trailing white spaces are very difficult to notice when cleaning data
manually. This is another advantage of using OpenRefine to clean your data - this process can be automated.

In newer versions of OpenRefine (from version 3.4.1) there is now an option to
clean leading and trailing white spaces from all data when importing the data initially and creating the project.

## Undoing / Redoing actions

It is common while exploring and cleaning a dataset to make a mistake or decide to change the order of the process you wish to conduct. OpenRefine provides `Undo` and `Redo` operations to make it easy to roll back your changes.

1. Click `Undo / Redo` in the left side of the screen. All the changes you have made will appear in the left-hand panel.
   The current stage in the data processing is highlighted in blue (i.e. step 4. in the screenshot below). As you click
   on the different stages in the process, the step identified in blue will change and, far more importantly, the data
   will revert to that stage in the processing.

2. We want to undo the splitting of the column `scientificName`. Select the stage just
   before the split occurred and the new `scientificName` columns will disappear.
3. Notice that you can still click on the last stage and make the columns reappear, and toggle back and forth between these states. You can also select the state more than one steps back and revert to that state.
4. Let's leave the dataset in the state in which the `scientificNames` were clustered, by selecting the stage just before the split.

## Trimming Leading and Trailing Whitespace

Words with spaces at the beginning or end are particularly hard for humans to identify from strings without these spaces (as we have seen with the `scientificName` column). However, blank spaces can make a big difference to computers, so we usually want to remove them.

1. In the header for the column `scientificName`, choose `Edit cells` > `Common transforms` > `Trim leading and trailing whitespace`.
2. Notice that the `Split` step has now disappeared from the `Undo / Redo` pane on the left and is replaced with a `Text transform on 3 cells`
3. Perform the same `Split` operation on `scientificName` that you undid earlier. This time you should now only get two new columns.

Removing the leading white spaces means that each entry in this column has exactly one space
(between the genus and species parts of the original `scientificName` data).
Therefore, when you now split with space as the separator, you should get only two columns. Let's do this as an exercise.

> ## Exercise
> Repeat the splitting of column `scientificName` exercise.

> > On the `scientificName` column, click the down arrow next to the `scientificName` column and

## Renaming columns

We now have the genus and species parts neatly separated into 2 columns - `scientificName 1` and `scientificName 2`.
We want to rename these as `genus` and `species`, respectively.
1. Let's first rename the `scientificName 1` column. On the column, click the down arrow and then `Edit column` > `Rename this column`.
3. Type "genus" into the box that appears.

> ## Exercise
>
> Try to change the name of the `scientificName 2` column to `species`. What problem do you encounter? How can you fix the problem?
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > 1. On the `scientificName 2` column, click the down arrow and then `Edit column` > `Rename this column`.
> > 2. Type "species" into the box that appears.
> > 3. A pop-up will appear that says `Another column already named species`. This is because there is another column
> > with the same name where we've recorded the species abbreviation.
> > 4. You can choose another name like `speciesName` for this column or change the other
> > `species` column name to `species_abbreviation` and then come back and rename this column to `species`.

**Important:** Undo the splitting and renaming steps and retain the white space trimming step
before moving on (it may be several steps back). If you skip this step, your solutions
for later exercises will not be the same as shown in exercise solutions.
