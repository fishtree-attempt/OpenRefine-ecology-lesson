# OpenRefine-ecology

**Data Cleaning with OpenRefine for Ecologists** Lesson for [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop)

## OpenRefine Version

The current version has been tested with OpenRefine 3.6.2 on October 2022.

## Data set notes

* This data set is derived from [The Portal Project Long-term desert ecology](http://portal.weecology.org/) project data. [This data file](http://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/Portal_rodents_19772002.csv) was downloaded and then modified specifically for use with OpenRefine.
    * Taxon names were put back into the file.
    * Globally Unique Identifiers (in the form of UUIDs) were added.
* These modifications were made in order to illustrate some features of Open Refine.
    - Errors were added to the taxon names (`scientificName` field), to demonstrate OpenRefine's ability to find likely mis-entered data.
    - These errors can be found using clustering algorithms on the `scientificName` column, showing the power of the algorithms to find discrepancies quickly and making it simple to fix all issues found.
