> ## Software
> 
> For this lesson you will need **OpenRefine** and a web browser.

> Download OpenRefine version 3.4.1 from [http://openrefine.org/download.html](http://openrefine.org/download.html).
> * Do not select beta versions or the release candidates. 
> * If you are on Windows and do not have Java installed, download the version `Windows kit with embedded Java`. 
> * Unzip the downloaded file into a directory and name that directory something like OpenRefine.
> * Check below for further instructions depending on your operating system.
> 
> OpenRefine requires one of these web browsers:
>  * Google Chrome
>  * Chromium
>  * Opera
>  * Microsoft Edge
>  
> OpenRefine has some issues with Firefox and Internet Explorer is not supported.
